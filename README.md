# SalvatoreDevPackage

This is a package for my portfolio page with my custom front-end workflow. In this package I'm using **gulp** as a task runner for copy, update, compile, etc.

### Usage:

1. Download/ Clone this repository
2. Run ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```
3. Run command ```gulp``` in command line
4. [You should see my portfolio page](https://supremesalvatore.github.io/SalvatoreDev/)
5. Start modifying in source files

**Any feedback is welcome!**
